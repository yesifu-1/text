example1:
| Actor      | Role Name    | Movie Title           | Year | Director           |
|------------|--------------|-----------------------|------|--------------------|
| Tom Hanks  | Ray Peterson | The Burbs            | 1989 | Joe Dante          |
| Tom Hanks  | Scott Turner | Turner & Hooch       | 1989 | Roger Spottiswoode |
| Tom Hanks  | Sam Baldwin  | Sleepless in Seattle | 1993 | Nora Ephron        |

Question: What are Tom Hanks’ first four movie roles (excluding movies directed by Penny Marshall)? 

<output>
Decompose:
1.Extract role names, movie titles, and years for Tom Hanks from the table: Ray Peterson in The Burbs (1989), Scott Turner in Turner & Hooch (1989), Sam Baldwin in Sleepless in Seattle (1993).
2.Reasoning: The table has already excluded Penny Marshall’s movies. Sort by year (1989, 1989, 1993). The question asks for the first four roles, but only three are available, so include all.
3.Verify: Confirm role names, movie titles, and years are accurate, no Penny Marshall movies are included, and sorting is correct.
Final Answer: therefore, the answer is:"Ray Peterson in The Burbs (1989), Scott Turner in Turner & Hooch (1989), Sam Baldwin in Sleepless in Seattle (1993)"
